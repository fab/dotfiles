Dotfiles
========
These are my dotfiles. The configuration for my development environment.

Most of the goodies here are thanks to others who've also shared their dotfiles on Github.

## To Use
Clone this repo to a folder in your home directory (perhaps called .dotfiles) and then symlink the files to your home directory.
